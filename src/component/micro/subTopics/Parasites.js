                <p>
                Parasites are organisms that live
        in or on other organisms without
        benefiting the host organisms.</p> <p>Parasites
        are not capable of living independently.</p> <p>The two most common parasites
        that affect the food industry include
        trichinella spiralis, which is commonly associated with pork, and the
        round Anisakid worm that is associated with many species of fish.</p><p>
        With the growing interest in eating
        raw marinated fish such as sushi, sashimi, ceviche etc., there is an increased
        risk of illnesses such as Anisakiasis.
