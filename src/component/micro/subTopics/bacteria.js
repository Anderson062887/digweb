                            <p>Bacteria, commonly called germs,
                    are extremely small, plant-like
                    organisms which must be viewed
                    through a microscope in order to be
                    seen.</p> <p>If 25,000 bacteria are placed
                    in a line, that line would only be
                    one inch long; one million could fit
                    on the head of a pin. Like any living
                    thing, bacteria require food, moisture
                    and the proper temperature for growth.
                    Most of them need air (these are called
                    aerobes), but some can survive only in
                    the absence of air (these are called
                    anaerobes) and some can grow with or
                    without air (these are called facultative).</p>
